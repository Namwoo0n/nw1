        <h1 id="smstext" class="heading">Good Morning From Mr.Namwoon!</h1>
        <h2 class="heading">Personality</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">Namwoon Kim is a major antagonist-turned-ally in Omniscient Readers Viewpoint. He was originally one of Junghyeok Yu's companions in Three Ways to Survive the Apocalypse. He was, however, killed by Dokja Kim in the present iteration and sent to Tarturus.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            At the start of the series, Namwoon is a violent and sadistic psychopath who sees the apocalypse as an opportunity to enact his homicidal urges. He justifies his actions as logical in this new world, seeing it as a new order to kill the weak. He seemingly respects Dokja when he thinks the man is as sadistic as him. His wrath does not exclude an innocent old lady. Despite his Darwinistic views, he is very cowardly and hypocritical, as he begs Dokja to spare his life.
            
            After spending time in Tarturus, Namwoon turned over a new leaf. While retaining his laidback and eccentric personality, he has lost interest in revenge and violence, even thanking Dokja for killing him since he is happy in the hellish world.</p>

        <h2 class="heading underline">Biography</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">Namwoon's life before the scenarios remains highly unknown, though he was a second-year student at Cheongil High School and lived under the tutelage of his strict parents. Namwoon was likely incredibly bored of this lifestyle as he was forced to repress his sadistic urges.

            The scenarios start with Namwoon and Dokja travelling in the same metro car. He is the first passenger in the carriage to acknowledge that the first scenario would require them to kill a live being.  After attempting to kill an old woman, he turns on Dokja and makes an effort to kill him as well. Due to Dokja's coin-boosted stats, the endeavor is unsuccessful, and he eventually passes away after failing to murder anyone within the scenario's allotted time. 
            
            Later, he makes a comeback as a resident of Tartarus and runs into Dokja just as the latter enters the Underworld. Namwoon responds to Dokja's inquiries by stating that he hasn't lately observed a young woman with white hair come in the Underworld and that he had been working on the creation of Hades's Giant Soldier, which Namwoon considers to be a Gundam. When the manager of the smithy approaches, he grabs Dokja by the shoulder and drags him to his workshop, where Dokja can act like he's hammering and stay out of trouble. This friendly demeanor as well as his statement that he had thought after entering Tartarus and is grateful that Dokja had slain him both astound Dokja.
            
            Namwoon, however, changes after learning that Dokja is still alive. When Dokja asks if there is someplace to hide from the administration, Namwoon offers the certainly deadly suggestion of entering the Gundam. Later, as Dokja is led to Hades' palace, he waves to Namwoon, who returns with a blank expression.</p>
